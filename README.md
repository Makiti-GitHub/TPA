Coding Challenge:
Training Provider 
A training provider wants to offer its products online. For that he needs one
Web application on which potential customers can find out about the training courses and
can book training. Each training course is offered on different dates. At
10 participant places are available for each appointment, those of potential customers individually
can be booked.
In terms of software architecture, a front end in Javascript is being considered, which uses a
REST API with
communicated to a backend.
1. REST API design (Spring Boot Java / NodeJs)
Design a REST API that maps the following frontend functionalities
can:
• Overview of all training courses offered (name of the training course, description, name
of the lecturers, price, ...)
• Display of training courses in a specific period
• Display of dates for a specific training course
• Creating/changing a new training course
• Creating/changing a new appointment for a training course
• Booking a training course on a specific date
This task is pure conception. It's not about writing source code, it's
to define the API.
2. Implementation server side
Program the server side of the API in Java. Build here
tests for the API. Set at least one reading and one modifying REST call
around. Make a sensible choice of the functionalities mentioned above in order to understand the
principle of to show implementation. It is not necessary to implement all of the above
functionality. The data does not have to be persisted beyond the termination of the application.
3. Implementation client side ( React / Angular)
Create a client in a frontend technology of your choice, with which a bis two REST calls can be
made. This task is not about a graphical one chic UI, but a PoC of the interaction between client
and server.
4.Security
What would you do in this application on the subject of security? What must why
secured and which concepts and technologies would you use for this?
This task is again pure conception. A conversion is not required.
